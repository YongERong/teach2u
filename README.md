_Learning Through Teaching_

## **Goal**
To provide a platform for students to identify misconceptions and gaps in their knowledge through teaching teachable agents. To then turn these interactions into condensed, reflective and easy to review materials.

## **Installation**
Install the necessary dependencies into a virtual environment using pip.

`pip install venv`

`python -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`streamlit run chat.py`

## **Limitations**
As Streamlit reloads the page each time a component is updated, it can get quite laggy.
## **Future**
- [ ] More models, more efficient
- [ ] Better user response validation
- [ ] Export conversations as flashcards and mindmaps
